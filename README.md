# Natural Selection Recipes
A web app for organizing all your favorite recipes in one place.

### Introduction

Natural Selection is our second project in Mod2 of Turing School of Software and Design (it is a paired project). The goal was to create a web app that uses multiple data sets including users, recipes, and ingredients. Upon load, the app logs in a random user along with their specific information including name and personal pantry items.<br>

### Directions and Features

On load the user will see a splash screen greeting the user by name. The user will then see all the recipes available represented by individual recipe cards. The site can be navigated by the blue nav bar on the top of the page.

**Search**<br>By typing in the search box, a user will see their results in real time. Searches can include recipe names, recipe ingredients, or recipe tags.

**View Recipe**<br>When a user selects the "View Recipe" button, an expanded window appears revealing the full recipe including ingredients with amounts, instructions, and tags associated.

**My Favorites**<br>When a user selects the "+/- My Favorites" button on a recipe card, the selected recipe will be added to the My Favorites tab on the nav bar. Upon clicking the "+/- My Favorites" button again, the recipe will be removed from this area.

**My Menu**<br>When a user selects the "+/- My Menu" button on a recipe card, the selected recipe will be added to the My Menu tab on the nav bar. This area is used to store recipes a user plans to cook in the near future. Once the user cooks this recipe, they can select the "+/- My Menu" button again to remove it from this area.
