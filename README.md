# Natural Selection Recipes

A place to organize your pantry and some delicious recipes
## How to Use 

The site currently logs you in as a user. From there, you can browse an assortment of recipes, and search through them based on their name, ingredients, or type (breakfast, lunch, appetizers, etc.)
From there, you can add a recipe to a favorites list or a weekly menu list to keep your meals for the week organized. 
When you choose to cook a recipe, you can compare the contents of your pantry to the ingredients of the recipe to make sure you have everything you need to make your meal.
